## Key Features Explained

### How Steps Tracking Works
The app uses your device's built-in pedometer to count steps throughout the day. Your daily count is saved locally and synced to our servers. Set a goal, and you'll get a notification when you hit it!

### Route Tracking & Maps
When you go for a run or walk, the app records your GPS path in real-time. These routes are saved so you can see exactly where you went, how far, and how long it took.

### Speed Monitoring
Using GPS technology, the app continuously monitors your current speed, calculates average speed, and tracks your fastest pace during any activity.

### Weather Integration
Real-time weather information is pulled from Finnish Meteorological Institute and displayed on your home screen so you can see if you need a jacket before heading out.

## Tips for Using the App

**Testing without Firebase?**
You can enable dev mode in `src/constants/config.ts` to skip login during development.

**Permissions**
Make sure to grant location and health/fitness permissions when the app first asks. This is required for tracking to work.

**Clear Your Data**
If you want to start fresh, you can clear all local data from the app settings.

**Faster Syncing**
Your activity data syncs to the cloud automatically, but you can also manually refresh by pulling down on the home screen.

## Troubleshooting

**App won't start?**
- Clear your cache: `npm start -- --clear`
- Reinstall dependencies: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

**Location/steps not tracking?**
- Check app permissions in your device settings
- Make sure location services are enabled
- Try restarting the app

**Firebase errors?**
- Verify your `.env` file has correct credentials
- Check that your Firebase project allows email/password auth
- Make sure Firestore is enabled in your Firebase console
